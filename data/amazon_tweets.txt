Twitter for iPhone,While we are on the subject it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars.

Twitter for iPhone,I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy.
